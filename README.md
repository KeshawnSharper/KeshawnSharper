 Hi, Iâ€™m Keshawn. I am a full stack web developer with a particular interest in front-end development. My specialties include Javascript, AngularJs, SASS, React and Redux, Jest, and Less. After multiple years spent collaborating, building, and swotting projects in web applications Iâ€™ve developed strong creative problem-solving, organizational, and communication skills. I am interested in combining those skills with web technologies to help build engaging and cutting-edge projects. If I'm not programming, I'm likely reading or playing basketball. If youâ€™d like to know more, feel free to get in touch!
